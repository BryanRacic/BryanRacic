## Hi 👋 I'm Bryan Racic _[he/him]_
Thanks for checking out my profile!

### About Me

I'm currently a data-engineer [@Packback](www.packback.co) working on overclocking higher education w/ AI, but previously worked on environmental monitoring hardware and machine vision for commerical fishing vessels, as well as transparent communication systems for the Entomology field.  

I've also cofounded a company focused on providing accessible & secure decentralized file storage. Check us out [@OpenSigil](www.opensigil.com) !

### What's Here?
You're going to find a bunch of half finished projects and dead repos (I'll get back to them _at some point_), but a couple highlights are
- A distributed network for bug sightings (FOR SCIENCE 🥼🐛🔬 ): https://github.com/BryanRacic/whitefly
- A zero-trust encryption solution: https://github.com/OpenSigil/Hedera22_OpenSigil
- A long range communications unit built for a music festival in the woods: https://github.com/BryanRacic/LoRaComms
- A **giant** 3d printed case for storing magnetized warhammer/rpg minis: https://github.com/BryanRacic/MagneticMiniCase
- A ChatGPT powered twitch streamer (that speaks with Walter White's voice): https://github.com/BryanRacic/openstreamer

### What's Next?
**¯\\_(ツ)_/¯**

Some of these were built for competitions, others to actually build and share something useful, but they all revolve around my pool of ever expanding interests and hobbies which include (_in no particular order_)

- 🤖 ML, Machine Vision & LLMs
- 🔒 Security & Encryption
- 🐸 Environmental Sustainability
- 🖨️ 3d Printing & Home Fabrication
- 👾 Games (retro, video, & tabletop)
- 💾 Hardware Hacking
- 🦈 Sharks (the animal)
