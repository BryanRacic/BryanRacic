## Hi 👋 I'm Bryan Racic _[he/him]_
Thanks for checking out my profile!

### About Me

I'm currently a data-engineer [@Packback](https://www.packback.co/) working on overclocking higher education w/ AI, but previously worked on environmental monitoring hardware and machine vision solutions for commerical fishing vessels, as well as transparent communication systems for the Entomology field.  

I've also cofounded a company focused on providing accessible, cheap & secure decentralized file storage. Check us out here: [@OpenSigil](https://opensigil.com/)

### What's Here?
You're going to find a bunch of half finished projects and dead repos (I'll get back to them _at some point_), but a couple highlights are
- A distributed network for bug sightings (FOR SCIENCE 🥼🐛🔬 ): https://github.com/BryanRacic/whitefly
- A zero-trust encryption solution: https://github.com/OpenSigil/Hedera22_OpenSigil
- A long range communications unit built for a music festival in the woods: https://github.com/BryanRacic/LoRaComms
- A **giant** 3d printed case for storing magnetized warhammer/rpg minis: https://github.com/BryanRacic/MagneticMiniCase
- An (early) ChatGPT powered Twitch streamer (that speaks with Walter White's voice): https://github.com/BryanRacic/openstreamer

### What's Not Here?
- [Arms Race](https://ctooley21.itch.io/arms-race): A "Clasic-Arcade-style roguelike where upgrades have consequences" I developed with a team for the GoDot Game Jam (#71)
- [Grindline Race](https://ctooley21.itch.io/grindline): A "skateboarding doodle game w/ unique traversal mechanics" I developed with a team for the GoDot Game Jam (#78)

### What's Next?
**¯\\_(ツ)_/¯**

Some of these were built for competitions, others to actually build and share something useful, but they all revolve around my pool of ever expanding interests and hobbies which include (_in no particular order_)

- 🤖 ML, Machine Vision & LLMs
- 🔒 Security & Encryption
- 🐸 Environmental Sustainability
- 🖨️ 3d Printing & Home Fabrication
- 👾 Games (retro, video, & tabletop)
- 💾 Hardware Hacking
- 🦈 Sharks (the animal)
- 🐍 Python (not the animal)
